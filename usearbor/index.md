There are a few ways to use Arbor

{% include toc.html %}

## Run Arbor on the cloud

You can run Arbor on one of our three servers:

- [arbor1](http://arbor1.arborworkflows.com/)
- [arbor2](http://arbor2.arborworkflows.com/)
- [arbor3](http://arbor3.arborworkflows.com/)

These three servers are all built on the same base, but are not connected to one another - so if you create an account and/or save things, the changes will only be local to that server. We are working on a github connection to allow versioning and facilitate collaborations.

## Use Arbor apps

You can use one of our simple [Arbor Apps]({{ site.baseurl }}/arborapps/).

## Install a local Arbor instance

You can [download and install your own Arbor instance using Vagrant](http://arborworkflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).

## Create your own cloud instance of arbor
