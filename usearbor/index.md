There are two main ways to use Arbor.

## Arbor apps

If you want to run a common comparative analysis in a simple and clean way using a web interface, you need to use Arbor apps. Arbor apps are websites that can run analyses - like ancestral state reconstruction and PGLS - using a straighforward drag and drop interface.

## Arbor workflows

If you want to build a workflow for your analysis, you need to use Arbor workflows. We current have three Arbor instances running on Amazon cloud that are free for you to use.
