## Add new functions and workflows to Arbor

It is straightforward to add new functions (in R or Python) to Arbor. You can also save, download, and share your Arbor functions and workflows with your friends. For instructions on how to do that, see our tutorials.

## Connect your R package to Arbor

If you have an R package stored on CRAN or github, you can immediately use functions from your package in Arbor. See our tutorial on adding new R functions to Arbor workflows.

## Create new Arbor apps

You can take a useful Arbor function or workflow and create a dedicated Arbor app, which is a web page that runs your algorithm. This requires just a bit of knowledge of javascript. You can get started with our tutorial.

## Access Arbor source code

Arbor workflows uses an open development paradigm. To get our source code, or to contribute to the project, please visit our github repository at [github.com/arborworkflows](https://github.com/arborworkflows).

In particular, you can access the [Arbor workflow main web application](https://github.com/arborworkflows), and [all current Arbor apps](https://github.com/arborworkflows/ArborWebApps).

Under the hood, Arbor uses open-source Kitware products: the workflow engine [romanesco](https://github.com/kitware/romanesco); the data management platform [girder](https://github.com/kitware/girder); and the web framework [tangelo](https://github.com/kitware/tangelo). We also draw liberally from a large number of R packages, and maintain our own, [aRbor](https://github.com/arborworkflows/aRbor).

For detailed instructions on installing Arbor on your own machine, go to [http://arborworkflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html](http://arborworkflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).
