Given a phylogenetic tree and some character data, we can estimate ancestral character states at the internal nodes of the tree. These ancestral character states are estimated (with uncertainty) based on a specified model of evolution.

Estimating ancestral character states requires a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths and data for the tips of the tree. In Arbor, you don't have to have a perfect match between the species in the tree and in your data file - but anything that is missing from either of those will be dropped from the analysis.

Arbor provides several ways to estimate ancestral character states. The easiest option is to use the Arbor App [Ancestral state estimation]({{ site.baseurl }}/arborapps/ancestral-state/). However, you can also estimate ancestral character states in Arbor Workflows using the aceArbor function.

## aceArbor (Arbor Workflows function)

aceArbor is a function for carrying out ancestral state reconstruction. It works for
both discrete and continuous variables, and can reconstruct ancestral character states
under both a maximum-likelihood and a Bayesian framework. The function returns results
in two formats: a table of ancestral state estimates for each node in the tree, and a plot
of the results.

### assumptions

- known phylogenetic tree with branch lengths
- specified model of evolution (see below)
- tip character states known without error

### inputs

- table: A data table including species names
- tree: A phylogenetic tree
- column: The name of the column to analyze
- type: The character type
  - discrete: a character with a discrete number of states
  - continuous: a continuously varying character
  - fromData: will attempt to determine the data type from the data itself
- method: specifies the method used to reconstruct ancestral character states
  - marginal: marginal ancestral state reconstructions, which reconstruct each node integrating over all possibilities at all other nodes in the tree; this is typically the method used in the literature to reconstruce ACEs
  - joint: joint ancestral reconstructions, which give the configuration of ancestral states that together maximize the likelihood of the data given model parameters
  - mcmc: reconstruct ancestral states using Bayesian MCMC. Note that the discrete version of this doesn't seem to work, and even if it did work it is not a full MCMC ancestral state method
  - stochastic: create stochastic character map


### outputs

- a table and a plot with results of the ancestral state reconstruction.

### example

From the [docs]({{ site.baseurl}}/../docs/ ) page, get anolis.phy and anolis.csv.
Load these files into Arbor, and use them as inputs to the aceArbor function. Choose
the "ecomorph" column for analysis, and select type: discrete and method: marginal.
