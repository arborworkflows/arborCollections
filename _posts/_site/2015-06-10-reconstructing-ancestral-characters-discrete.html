<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this exercise, we will learn how to reconstruct ancestral character states in Arbor for a discrete character - that is, a character that can take on one of a number of discrete values. Examples might be lizards, “legs” versus “no legs” - this would be a two-state discrete character. Another example would be animal locomotion - “walks,” “swims,” or “flies.” This is an example of a three-state discrete character.</p>

<p>Imagine that you have a phylogenetic tree with information on some discrete character for some or all of the tips. You want to use mathematical methods to reconstruct the ancestral character states on the internal nodes of the tree. Then, this is the exercise for you!</p>
