## phylogeneticSignal: function

### collection: phylogenies

## Overview

phylogeneticSignal is a function for estimating and testing for phylogenetic signal. It works for
both discrete and continuous variables, and can use a variety of methods. It calls the aRbor package function [physigArbor](https://github.com/arborworkflows/aRbor/blob/master/R/physigArbor.R)

## Example

From the [docs] ({{ site.baseurl}}/../docs/ ) page, get anolis.phy and anolis.csv.
Load these files into Arbor, and use them as inputs to the phylogeneticSignal function. Choose
the "SVL" column for analysis, and select type: lambda.

## Arguments
- table: A data table including species names
- tree: A phylogenetic tree
- column: The name of the column to analyze
- method: either "K" for Blomberg's K or "lambda" for Pagel's lambda

## Outputs
Function outputs a table with results from the test of phylogenetic signal.
