## Overview

Makes a cophylo plot (sometimes called a tanglegram) connecting interacting tips on two trees.

## Example

data(anolis)
td <- make.treedata(anolis$phy, anolis$dat, name_column=1)

## Arguments

- t1: tree 1
- t2: tree 2
- assoc: matrix containing the tip labels in tr1 to match to the tip labels in tr2. Note that not all labels in either tree need to be included; and, furthermore, one label in tr1 can be matched with more than one label in tr2, or vice versa.

## Outputs

- cophyloPlot: A plot with tips matched.
