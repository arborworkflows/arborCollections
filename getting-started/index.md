The basics for getting started with Arbor.

{% include toc.html %}

## Running Arbor

You can run Arbor on our [server](http://arbor1.arborworkflows.com).

If you want to try Arbor, start with our tutorial on [using the Arbor webapp]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/using-the-arbor-webapp/). You can also get information on [creating your own collection]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/creating-a-new-collection/) to save data and analyses. There are several [more advanced tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/) that carry on from there.

Finally, you can learn about [Arbor apps]( {{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/arborapps/).

Alternatively, you can [download and install your own Arbor instance using Vagrant](http://arborworkflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).
