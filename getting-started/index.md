## Running Arbor

You can run Arbor on our [server](arbor.kitware.com).

If you want to try Arbor, start with our tutorial on [using the Arbor webapp](). You can also get information on [creating your own collection]() to save data and analyses. Finally, you can learn about [easy mode]().

Alternatively, you can [download and install your own Arbor instance using Vagrant](http://arborworkflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).
