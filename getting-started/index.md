The basics for getting Skinny Bones setup.

{% include toc.html %}

## Installation

Skinny Bones requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) 2+. Make sure to run `gem update jekyll` if you aren't on the latest version or `gem install jekyll` if this is your first time installing it.

If you are creating a new Jekyll site using Skinny Bones following these steps:

1. [Download Skinny Bones](https://github.com/mmistakes/skinny-bones-jekyll/archive/master.zip) and unzip.
2. Rename `skinny-bones-jekyll-master` to something meaningful ie: `new-site`
3. Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), etc)
4. Update `_config.yml`, add navigation, and add posts/pages. Full details below.

If you want to use Skinny Bones with an existing Jekyll site follow these steps:

1. [Download Skinny Bones](https://github.com/mmistakes/skinny-bones-jekyll/archive/master.zip) and unzip.
2. Rename `skinny-bones-jekyll-master` to something meaningful ie: `new-site`
3. Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), etc)
4. Add all of your existing posts, pages, and any other content you want to move over.
5. Update YAML front matter blocks to match names used by Skinny Bones. Full details below.
6. Update `config.yml`, add navigation links. Full details below.

## Running Jekyll

If `jekyll build` and `jekyll serve` throw errors you may have to run Jekyll with `bundled exec` instead.

> In some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.
>
>However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.

## Scaffolding

How Skinny Bones is organized and what the various files are. All posts, layouts, includes, stylesheets, assets, and whatever else is grouped nicely under the root folder. The compiled Jekyll site outputs to `_site/`.

## Site Setup

A quick checklist of the files you'll want to edit to get up and running.

---

### Site Wide Configuration

`_config.yml` is your friend. Open it up and personalize it. Most variables are self explanatory but here's an explanation of each anyways:

#### Site Title

The title of your site... shocker!

Example `title: Skinny Bones`

#### Site Description

A description of your site. Used in page meta.

Example `description: "A lightweight site starter for Jekyll"`

#### Site Logo

Site logo, used mostly as a default image that appears on Twitter Cards if a large feature image isn't present. If used place a square image around 120 x 120 pixels in `/images/`.

Example `logo: 120x120.gif`

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/twitter-card-screenshot.jpg" alt="sample Twitter Card screenshot">
  <figcaption>Site logo is used for Twitter Cards when a feature image is not defined for the page.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Site Teaser Image

Default teaser image used for posts and pages that do not have one assigned. This image shows up in the archive grid module. If can have whatever dimensions you want, I've found that an image with rectangular proportions work nicely. Like the site logo, place in `/images/`.

Example `teaser: 400x250.gif`

#### Site URL

Used to generate absolute URLs in `sitemap.xml`, `atom.xml`, and for generating canonical URLs in `<head>`. When developing locally either comment this out or use something like `http://localhost:4000` so all assets load properly. *Don't include a trailing `/`*. [Protocol-relative URLs](http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/) are a nice option but there are a few caveats[^protocol].

Examples:

{% highlight yaml %}
url: http://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll
url: http://localhost:4000
url: //cooldude.github.io
url: 
{% endhighlight %}

[^protocol]: If you decide to use a protocol-relative URL know that it will most likely break sitemap.xml that the Jekyll-Sitemap gem creates. If a valid sitemap matters to you I'd suggest [creating your own sitemap.xml](http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/generating-a-sitemap-in-jekyll-without-a-plugin/) and apply some Liquid logic to prepend links to posts/pages with `https:`.

---

### Navigation Links

To set what links appear in the top navigation edit `_data/navigation.yml`. Use the following format to set the URL, title, teaser image/description (used in off-canvas menu) of each link:

{% highlight yaml %}
- title: Portfolio
  url: /portfolio/
  excerpt: "Things I’ve designed, illustrated, developed, coded, and whatever."
  image: 300x200.gif

- title: Made Mistakes
  url: http://mademistakes.com  
{% endhighlight %}

To set what links appear in the footer edit `_data/footer.yml`. Use the following format for each link:

{% highlight yaml %}
- title: Subscribe
  url: /subscribe/

- title: External Page
  url: http://mademistakes.com  
{% endhighlight %}

---

### Posts

#### Organizing Posts

Create new MarkDown (.md) files in `_posts`. If you aren't using categories to organize your posts then don't worry about this next bit. I like to organize all my posts by a single category and file them under sub-directories beneath `_posts`. For example if I have post named `2014-06-01-new-post.md` and it has a category of `foo` it will have the following path:

`_posts/foo/2014-06-01-new-post.md`

Which when process by jekyll would have a URL of `domain.com/foo/new-post/`.

---

### YAML Front Matter

The only YAML Front Matter required for posts and pages are `title` and `layout`, everything else is optional.

#### Categories

Add `categories: ` and assign a single category name for added organization. The theme makes the assumption that posts will only be assigned to one category at a time. You can certainly assign multiple categories but unexpected things may happen with the permalink structure.

I like to group posts by general categories like `articles`, `portfolio`, `whatever`, and using tags to more specific classifications.

#### Modified Date

If you assign a modified date to a post or page it will override the published date and appear in the page footer with the following format `Updated August 27, 2014`. It's also used as metadata to give search engines another piece of info about your content.

I like to use this [Sublime Text plugin](https://github.com/FichteFoll/sublimetext-insertdate) to insert the current date after I've updated a post, but you can do it manually to. It should follow the same date format used by Jekyll when naming posts: `YYYY-MM-DD`.

{% highlight YAML %}
modified: 2014-08-27
modified: 2014-08-27T11:57:41-04:00 # more verbose, also acceptable
{% endhighlight %}

#### Images

Here you can define the various images assigned to posts and pages. 

##### Featured Images

A good rule of thumb is to keep feature images nice and wide so you don't push the body text too far down. An image cropped around around 1024 x 256 pixels will keep file size down with an acceptable resolution for most devices without bloating your site. If you want to level-up your site I'd suggest looking at the [Jekyll Picture Tag](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/jekyll-picture-tag) plugin[^plugins] to make them responsive.

[^plugins]: If you're using GitHub Pages to host your site be aware that plugins are disabled. You'll need to build your site locally and then manually deploy if you want to use this sweet plugin.

The post and page layouts make the assumption that the feature images live in the `images/` folder. To add a feature image to a post or page just include the filename in the front matter like so.

{% highlight yaml %}
image:
  feature: feature-image-filename.jpg
{% endhighlight %}

To add attribution to a feature image use the following YAML front matter on posts or pages. Image credits appear directly below the feature image with a link back to the original source (if supplied).

{% highlight yaml %}
image:
  feature: feature-image-filename.jpg
  credit: Michael Rose #name of the person or site you want to credit
  creditlink: http://mademistakes.com #url to their site or licensing
{% endhighlight %}

##### Teasers Images

Teaser images appear on archive pages in the post grid and are also used in the off-canvas menu. If you don't assign a teaser image for a specific post or page, the default one will be used. The default image can be set in `_config.yml` under site wide configuration `teaser: 400x250.gif`. Teaser images should be roughly 400 x 250 pixels to scale comfortably across screen sizes.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/teaser-screenshot.jpg" alt="teaser image screenshot">
  <figcaption>Images outlined in red show how teasers typically display</figcaption>
</figure>

Similar to feature images you don't want to go crazy and use large high resolution assets for your teasers. Keep in mind performance and balance accordingly.

To assign a teaser image on a post use the following YAML:

{% highlight yaml %}
image:
  teaser: 400x250.gif
  feature: feature-image-filename.jpg
  credit: Michael Rose #name of the person or site you want to credit
  creditlink: http://mademistakes.com #url to their site or licensing
{% endhighlight %}

#### Table of Contents

For longer posts you may find it beneficial to include a table of contents menu. Add `{% raw %}{% include toc.html %}{% endraw %}` where you'd like the TOC to appear and Kramdown will take care of the rest by converting all headlines to list of links.

If you need to alter the *Overview* headline text that appears at the top of the list, you can modify it in `main.js`.

#### Google AdSense

To use Google Ads on your site create a [Google AdSense account](https://www.google.com/adsense/) and then add your `ad-client` and `ad-slot` variables to `_config.yml`. To show ads on a post/page add `ads: true` to the YAML Front Matter.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/google-adsense-responsive.jpg" alt="responsive type">
</figure>

Select **responsive** for ad type, allowing it to display at various sizes. If you'd like to use a different ad network just edit the appropriate HTML and JavaScript found in `_includes/advertising.html`.

#### Disqus Comments

Create a [Disqus](http://disqus.com) account and change `disqus-shortname` in `_config.yml` to the Disqus *shortname* you just setup. To enable commenting on a post, add the following to its YAML Front Matter:

{% highlight yaml %}
comments: true
{% endhighlight %}

#### Social Sharing Links

Social sharing links for Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ are included on posts/pages using the `article` and `media` layouts by default. To hide them on specific posts or pages add `share: false` to the YAML Front Matter. If you'd like to use different social networks modify `_includes/share-this.html` to your liking. Icons are set using [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/social-sharing-links-screenshot.jpg" alt="social sharing links screenshot">
  <figcaption>Share links appear the below author details block.</figcaption>
</figure>

---

### Pages

#### Organizing Pages

Maintaining pretty URLs for your site can be handled in two ways when creating new pages.

Place a `.md` file at the root level and add the appropriate permalink to the YAML Front Matter. For example if you want your **About** page to live at `domain.com/about/` create a file named `/about.md` and add `permalink: /about/` to its YAML Front Matter.

Or you can create `/about/index.md` and omit the YAML permalink. Up to you how you'd like to organize your pages.

### Archives

Create an archive page for each category or section of your site that you want to list a collection of posts. On these pages you'll want to use the `archive` layout and use a variation of the following for the page's content changing `foo` to the appropriate category you want to list posts from.

{% highlight html %}
<div class="tiles">
{{ "{% for post in site.categories.foo " }}%}
  {{ "{% include post-grid.html " }}%}
{{ "{% endfor " }}%}
</div><!-- /.tiles -->
{% endhighlight %}

If you'd prefer a less visual list of posts use `{{ "{% include post-list.html " }}%}` instead of the `post-grid.html` _include.

---

## Adding New Content with Octopress

While completely optional, I've included Octopress and some starter templates to automate the creation of new posts and pages. To take advantage of it start by installing the [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) gem if it isn't already. It is safe to remove Octopress from your Gemfile if you have no need for it.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install octopress --pre
{% endhighlight %}

### New Post

Default command

{% highlight bash %}
$ octopress new post "Post Title"
{% endhighlight %}

Default works great if you want all your posts in one directory, but if you're like me and want to group them into sub-folders like `/articles`, `/portfolio`, etc. Then this is the command for you. By specifying the DIR it will create a new post in that folder and populate `categories:` with the same value.

{% highlight bash %}
{% endhighlight %}

The default `_layout` used for new posts is `articles`. If you want to use the media layout or something else specify it like so

{% highlight bash %}
$ octopress new post "Portfolio Post Title" --dir portfolio --template media
{% endhighlight %}

### New Page

To create a new page use the following command.

{% highlight bash %}
$ octopress new page about/
{% endhighlight %}

This will create a page at `/about/index.md`

## Contributing

Found a bug or aren't quite sure how something works? By all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/mmistakes/skinny-bones-jekyll/issues) on GitHub. For straight forward bug fixes feel free to submit pull requests. 

**Skinny Bones** was built predominately as a framework for [my own site](http://mademistakes.com). My intention was never to make it all things for all people. So please keep that in mind before submitting new features or enhancements. If you've used any of my [Jekyll themes](http://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/) I think it's pretty clear what I like and what I try to avoid. When in doubt ask before wasting your time on a feature that won't get merged in.
