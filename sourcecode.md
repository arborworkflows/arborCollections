Arbor workflows uses an open development paradigm. To get our source code, or to contribute to the project, please visit our github repository at [github.com/arborworkflows](https://github.com/arborworkflows).

In particular, the Arbor workflow main web application is [here](https://github.com/arborworkflows), and all current Arbor apps are [here](https://github.com/arborworkflows/ArborWebApps).

Under the hood, Arbor uses on several open-source Kitware products: the workflow engine [romanesco](https://github.com/kitware/romanesco); the data management platform [girder](https://github.com/kitware/girder); and the web framework [tangelo](https://github.com/kitware/tangelo). We also draw liberally from a large number of R packages, and maintain our own, [aRbor](https://github.com/arborworkflows/aRbor).

For detailed instructions on installing Arbor on your own machine, go to [http://arborworkflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html](http://arborworkflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).
