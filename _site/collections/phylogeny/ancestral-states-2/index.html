<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>aceArbor is a function for carrying out ancestral state reconstruction. It works for
both discrete and continuous variables, and can reconstruct ancestral character states
under both a maximum-likelihood and a Bayesian framework. The function returns results
in two formats: a table of ancestral state estimates for each node in the tree, and a plot
of the results.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>From the [docs] (/arborCollections/../docs/ ) page, get anolis.phy and anolis.csv.
Load these files into Arbor, and use them as inputs to the aceArbor function. Choose
the “ecomorph” column for analysis, and select type: discrete and method: marginal.</p>

<h2 id="arguments">Arguments</h2>
<ul>
  <li>table: A data table including species names</li>
  <li>tree: A phylogenetic tree</li>
  <li>column: The name of the column to analyze</li>
  <li>type: The character type
    <ul>
      <li>discrete: a character with a discrete number of states</li>
      <li>continuous: a continuously varying character</li>
      <li>fromData: will attempt to determine the data type from the data itself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>method: specifies the method used to reconstruct ancestral character states
    <ul>
      <li>marginal: marginal ancestral state reconstructions, which reconstruct each node integrating over all possibilities at all other nodes in the tree; this is typically the method used in the literature to reconstruce ACEs</li>
      <li>joint: joint ancestral reconstructions, which give the configuration of ancestral states that together maximize the likelihood of the data given model parameters</li>
      <li>mcmc: reconstruct ancestral states using Bayesian MCMC. Note that the discrete version of this doesn’t seem to work, and even if it did work it is not a full MCMC ancestral state method</li>
      <li>stochastic: create stochastic character map</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outputs">Outputs</h2>
<p>Function outputs a table and a plot with results of the ancestral state reconstruction.</p>
